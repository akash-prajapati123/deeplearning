        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">Potato disease classification involves identifying and categorizing different types of diseases that affect potato plants. Diseases can have a significant impact on potato yields and quality, making it crucial to identify and manage them effectively. Here are some common potato diseases and their classification: </p>

          <h3>Early Blight</h3>
          <p>Early blight is a fungal disease that affects the leaves, stems, and fruits of potato plants. It typically appears as dark lesions with concentric rings on the leaves, starting from the lower foliage. The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and can lead to reduced yield and quality.</p>

          <h3>Healthy Leaf</h3>
          <p>A healthy potato leaf is vibrant green, smooth, and free from discoloration, spots, or lesions. It plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, supports vigorous plant growth, and is resistant to diseases. Healthy leaves are essential for maximizing potato crop yield and quality.</p>

          <h3>Late Blight</h3>
          <p>Late blight is a devastating and highly destructive disease that affects potato plants. It is caused by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which can rapidly spread and cause significant economic losses in potato crops. Late blight is notorious for its historical impact, as it was responsible for the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s, leading to widespread famine.</p>
